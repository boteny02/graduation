## About Graduation 
This is app that helps graduate of an instituion to own a cv page on the Alumia Website. We leverage on Laravel,  a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe App will ensure that alumia management team could ensure members could register  and subsequently own a right to enjoy benefit of institution.
Graduate takes the pain out of alumia gap with alumnus by easing common tasks such as:

- 1. Overall List of Alumnia
- 2. traacking and searching members
- 3. grant members right to own a customised CV
